This is a python script to download your emails from gmail (or any IMAP server) and place in message in its own file in a directory.  I setup a cron job to run nightly to back up all of my emails.

gmail_downloader.py - The python script.  You can view the options by running with the '-h' flag
gmail_downloader.sh - A shell script that passes all options to the python script. This is what my cron just calls. It tracks the last download so it only does the messages since the last run.
